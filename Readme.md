This is a project for The Odin Project's foundation course. My intention for the project is to refine and demonstrate my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The calculator now functions accordingly, including with negative numbers.

Upadates: 

- Numerous bug fixes including division operation, proper storage after pressing equal, stringed operations.

Version 0.6

Numerous fixes have been made adhering to TOP Gotcha #1 listed in the assignment. The calculator can now string together multiple operations. Also, the functions return/display appropriate results. The delete button now works. A bug of note is entering an operation after pressing the equal sign. Otherwise, the calculator is relatively functional.

The calculator has a working interface that can do basic functions involving a single operator and two operands, as well as reset. There are many holes in it's ability to function.
